Almost every single software application relies on storing data somewhere accessible.
For small scripts and programs, this is often in the computer’s memory, or sometimes
just as plain text or binary files on the local disk.

Larger applications, however, will almost certainly use a database that exists
externally to the program itself, and the most popular technology of choice for
databases these days is the relational database. Most relational databases can be
queried using Structured Query Language (SQL), so it’s imperative for a software
engineer to have more than just a basic understanding of SQL to write efficient code for
interacting with databases.

If you’re thinking “oh, but I already know how to select data from my database, surely
it’s not much harder than that”, think again! I’ve seen plenty of code that will use a
`for` loop to accomplish a task that would be achieved much quicker and more simply with
a SQL `JOIN` clause.

This article will use a very basic example to demonstrate just how powerful using SQL
properly can be. The code for the article is written in Python using the
[SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) ORM library, but I will include the raw SQL
that the program intends to emulate to be more language-agnostic.

While the example and tests will seem simple, this is adapted from real code that I have
seen in production, so pay attention!

TL;DR: the SQL `JOIN` implementation is _much_ faster.

# The Example

The example I will use is one of an online store. The database will contain a `users`
table and an `orders` table, which will store information on the site’s users and any
orders placed by those users. Each table has an ID column and the `orders` table
contains a `user_id` column containing a foreign key that references the `users` table.

## Python

## SQL

# The Test Setup

As you can see, each `order` has a `payment_status` column, which contains a boolean for
whether the order was paid successfully or not. The aim is to test a function that finds
the users that have had at least one failed order and returns a set of `User` objects
describing those users.

The test will be run against a local dockerised MySQL database, created using the
following `docker-compose.yml` file:

The database will be preloaded with a number of users and orders generated using the
Python `faker` library. The test will be run with every combination of 10, 100 and 1000
users and orders, and timed over 100 iterations using the Python `timeit` library.

In order to avoid inconsistencies used by database caching, each query will be prefixed
with the `SQL_NO_CACHE` flag.

There will be two test functions. One will use a naive Python implementation that
involves querying for failed orders, then looping over the results and running a select
statement against the `users` table on each iteration to generate a set of `User`
objects with at least one failed order. The second implementation will use SQL `JOIN`
and `DISTINCT` to generate the same set of users in a single query.

The code for the functions can be seen below.

## Python

## SQL

It should be fairly clear from the code that the implementation using the SQL `JOIN`
will make only one database query, whereas the more naive Python implementation will
make a minimum of 1 and a maximum of N queries where N is the number of rows in the
`orders` table.

# The Results

Unsurprisingly, the pure SQL implementation of the function is much, much faster than
the implementation that relies on a Python `for` loop.

At 10 users and 10 orders, the Python function completed in 5.97ms, while the SQL
implementation took only 1.04ms. As the number of rows in the `orders` table increased,
and so did the runtimes, but things started looking a lot worse for Python.

At 10 users and 1000 orders, the SQL implementation was still sitting pretty at 1.28ms,
while the Python implementation took 458.49ms per test! This is, of course, because the
SQL implementation made only one database call whereas the Python implementation will
have made ~500 calls.

Interestingly, the number of rows in the `users` column had very little impact on the
Python implementation in terms of runtime but had a larger impact on the SQL
implementation. This is likely due to the MySQL server having to do more work to find
`DISTINCT` users in a larger list, whereas the Python version built the `set` object
user by user.

The full results can be seen below, along with some charts showing how the performance
of each function scaled with the number of rows in the database.

# Conclusion

While both implementations above could certainly be optimised to squeeze out slightly
more performance, the SQL implementation will win every single time. The best part is,
the SQL used is actually very simple, and anyone can learn it!

There are plenty of free resources online for learning SQL, so if you’re a software
engineer or an aspiring one, get out there and get studying! The benefits will be
enormous.
