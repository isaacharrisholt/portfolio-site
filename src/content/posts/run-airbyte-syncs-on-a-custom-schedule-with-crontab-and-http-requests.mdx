[Airbyte](https://airbyte.com/) is a fantastic tool that’s recently been making waves in
the data engineering community. It’s an open-source tool for running ELT (extract, load
and transform) processes. It’s a great replacement for expensive software such as
Fivetran, and could save your company thousands each month.

From here on, I’m going to assume you have a working knowledge of how Airbyte is
structured and how you would use it in a production environment.

Airbyte is great, however, as it stands currently, Airbyte doesn’t have first class
support for cron-style scheduling for connection syncs. This is coming very soon, but
it’s not quite ready, and my company runs an older version of Airbyte, with no need to
upgrade yet.

When it comes to scheduling currently, there are a few options, like having your sync
run every minute, hour, day, etc., but if you want anything more specific, or if you
want to orchestrate your syncs yourself, it’s not possible from within the UI, which is
how most users will interact with Airbyte for the most part.

But fear not! Not only does Airbyte expose a great UI for managing your ELT processes,
but it also exposes a HTTP REST API that allows you to use POST requests to trigger
connections from an outside source.

The full API documentation is
[here](https://airbyte-public-api-docs.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/rapidoc-api-docs.html),
but if you read on, I’ll show you how you can use Crontab and Python to run your syncs
on your own schedule. Of course, you’re welcome to use whatever tools and languages you
like for this.

### ⚙️ Connecting to the API

All of the endpoints that Airbyte exposes are POST endpoints, which makes it very easy
to interact with. Since Airbyte is containerised, I’m going to assume that you’re using
all the default ports that Airbyte ships with and that you’re going to be running your
Python script on the same machine.

The following code is very simple and will use the API to trigger every enabled
connection simultaneously, but it should give you reasonable familiarity with the
endpoints you’ll need to hit.

If you’re using Python, you’ll need to make sure you have the `requests` module
installed, and then start by writing a function to get the Airbyte workspaces associated
with your installation:

```python

from typing import List

import requests

API_ROOT = 'http://localhost:8000/api/v1'  # This is the default for Airbyte


def get_workspaces() -> List[str]:
    response = requests.post(f'{API_ROOT}/workspaces/list')
    response.raise_for_status()  # Either handle this yourself, or use a tool like Sentry for logging
    return [
        workspace['workspaceId']
        for workspace in repsonse.json()['workspaces']
    ]
```

Each workspace in Airbyte will have a number of sources, a number of destinations and a
number of connections that determine the flow of data from source to destination. In
order to trigger a sync, we first have to get a list of the connections for each
workspace, and then trigger each one individually. We can do that with the following two
functions:

```python
def get_connections_for_workspace(workspace_id: str) -> List[str]:
    response = requests.post(
        f'{API_ROOT}/connections/list',
        json={'workspaceId': workspace_id},
    )
    response.raise_for_status()
    return [
        connection['connectionId']
        for connection in response.json()['connections']
        if connection['status'] == 'active'  # So we can still disable connections in the UI
    ]


def trigger_connection_sync(connection_id: str) -> dict:
    response = requests.post(
        f'{API_ROOT}/connections/sync',
        json={'connectionId': connection_id},
    )
    response.raise_for_status()
    return response.json()
```

Then, all we have to do is wrap this up into a neat little package, which leaves the
whole program looking like this:

```python

from typing import List

import requests

API_ROOT = 'http://localhost:8000/api/v1'  # This is the default for Airbyte


def get_workspaces() -> List[str]:
    response = requests.post(f'{API_ROOT}/workspaces/list')
    response.raise_for_status()  # Either handle this yourself, or use a tool like Sentry for logging
    return [
        workspace['workspaceId']
        for workspace in repsonse.json()['workspaces']
    ]


def get_connections_for_workspace(workspace_id: str) -> List[str]:
    response = requests.post(
        f'{API_ROOT}/connections/list',
        json={'workspaceId': workspace_id},
    )
    response.raise_for_status()
    return [
        connection['connectionId']
        for connection in response.json()['connections']
        if connection['status'] == 'active'  # So we can still disable connections in the UI
    ]


def trigger_connection_sync(connection_id: str) -> dict:
    response = requests.post(
        f'{API_ROOT}/connections/sync',
        json={'connectionId': connection_id},
    )
    response.raise_for_status()
    return response.json()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    workspaces = get_workspaces()
    connections = []
    
    for workspace_id in workspaces:
        connections.extend(get_connections_for_workspace(workspace_id))
       
    for connection_id in connections:
        trigger_connection_sync(connection_id)
```

And that’s it for the Python side of things. All that’s left is to schedule this script
to run!

### 🕒 Scheduling Your Airbyte Syncs

Once again, you can use whatever you like for this, but I like using Crontab because
it’s easy and quick. It would be just as viable to adjust the above script to use the
Python `schedule` package and run it in the background at all times.

If you decide you just want to use Crontab, make sure it’s installed on your machine. I
like to use Crontab.guru to make sure I’m going to get the schedule I want. I’m not
going to give a full tutorial here, but if you wanted to run your Airbyte syncs between
6am and 6pm on the hour, you’d insert the following line into your Crontab using the
`crontab -e` command:

`00 6-18 * * * python3 force_airbyte_sync.py`

Save your Crontab, and make sure it’s inserted correctly with `crontab -l`. Then sit
back, relax and enjoy spending 50% less on your ELT process!
