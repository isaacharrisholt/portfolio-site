My first Android phone ever was the first Google Pixel, all the way back in
October 2016. I like to get my hands on the newest tech, so when it came time to replace
my Huawei P20, I was almost certain that I was going to get my hands on the Pixel 6 or
its Pro counterpart when they released.

Despite looking at other options such as the Samsungâ€™s Galaxy S21 Ultra and Huaweiâ€™s
gorgeous Mi 11 Ultra, when it came to Pixel 6 launch day, I pre-ordered my Pixel 6 Pro
almost immediately. Not only was it significantly cheaper than its competitors at Â£849,
but it also packed a fantastic-looking camera system and came with feature-enriched
Android 12 straight out of the box.

### Design

When I look at my new phone, the first word that comes to mind is â€˜divisiveâ€™.
Personally, Iâ€™m a fan of the camera visor that Google opted for. Itâ€™s a far cry from the
norm, but it does away with the bland little black circles that you see on almost every
other phone nowadays.

However, I can see why some people arenâ€™t fans. The visor does take up a far larger area
on the back of the phone than the more traditional camera bump, and itâ€™s not necessarily
as sleek.

Maybe Iâ€™m weird â€” I did opt for the â€˜Sorta Sunnyâ€™ colour variant after all â€” but I do
love how the phone looks. The polished aluminium accents gleam in the light, and the
phone is so smooth all the way around that it almost feels like itâ€™s melting into your
hands when you hold it.

### Display

All you need to know is that it is very much a flagship-quality display. It has all the
features weâ€™ve come to expect of top-of-the-range phones, and it looks vibrant and crisp
while doing so. Itâ€™s stunning.

The 6 Pro sports a 6.7-inch â€˜Smooth Displayâ€™ made from Corning Gorilla Glass Victus.
Naturally, itâ€™s an OLED screen that is capable of a refresh rate of up to 120Hz, but
that can drop as low as 10Hz when itâ€™s not needed to save on battery.

### Camera

Despite how much Iâ€™ve praised every other aspect of the Google Pixel 6 Pro so far, the
camera is where this phone shines the most. Pixel phones have always been at the top of
the smartphone camera leaderboards, but the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro really do take that to a
new level.

The phone comes equipped with a 50MP main shooter, a 40MP telephoto lens and a 12MP
ultrawide camera with a 114Â° field of view. The lenses and sensors themselves are, of
course, very capable pieces of hardware, but where the camera really shines is in
Googleâ€™s Tensor-powered post-processing.

If you take a photo, then immediately look at it in the gallery, after about a second
youâ€™ll notice it suddenly increase vastly in quality, and thatâ€™s all down to the funky
algorithms residing in the Android 12 camera app.

Low light performance is also very good, and the app has all the usual photo modes. I
havenâ€™t had much opportunity to try the new motion modes, so maybe follow me on Twitter
or Instagram to see those when they pop up ðŸ˜‰

### Performance and Battery Life

One of the most talked-about features of the Pixel 6 line-up was that Google has
developed their own in-house processor dubbed â€˜Tensorâ€™. I donâ€™t have any flagship
Snapdragon processors to compare it to, but it certainly feels fast enough and Iâ€™ve
never noticed any performance issues. Googleâ€™s on-device AI/ML powered by the dedicated
chip in the processor also works fantastically, allowing for accurate captioning and
translation even when offline.

The battery lasts all day, and I donâ€™t charge my phone overnight, instead opting to
juice it up to about 70â€“80% when I wake up in the morning. I can do that in about 20
minutes with Googleâ€™s 30W fast charger (though the phone
[only uses 23W at any given time](https://www.gsmarena.com/google_clarifies_pixel_6_series_can_charge_at_up_to_23w_speeds-news-51894.php)).

### Software

Android 12 is great. I really do love it. The customisation options are awesome and itâ€™s
the first operating system Iâ€™ve ever used that actually feelsâ€¦ fun! The design style
makes it feel as if you live in a bouncy castle and I canâ€™t get enough of it.

As I mentioned earlier, the phone feels fast, and I havenâ€™t noticed any considerable
slow-downs. However, I do have one _major_ gripe with this phone â€” the way it handles
firmware updates. From time to time, my Pixel 6 Pro will justâ€¦ restart. In fairness, it
does it when Iâ€™m not actively using the phone, and it restarts quickly, but it does get
annoying when I miss notifications because network services are disabled after a reboot.
This doesnâ€™t happen often, but still just enough to get on my nerves.

### Sound

The speakers on the phone are fine. Theyâ€™re nothing special, but they sound better the
higher the volume and most people will be using Bluetooth headphones to consume video or
audio content anyway.

### In Conclusionâ€¦

Iâ€™m very happy with the choice I made with the Pixel 6 Pro. I saved a butt tonne of
money on the handset itself compared to my other options, itâ€™s great to use, and itâ€™s
perfect for anyone who spends a lot of time consuming content of all forms, from reading
the news to gaming at 120fps.
