I type a lot. Like, a lot a lot. I‚Äôm a software engineer during the day, and then I come
home, do more programming and then write articles like this one you‚Äôre reading now. It‚Äôs
important to me to have a nice keyboard that I can enjoy typing on and that‚Äôs
comfortable for long periods of time. I used to have a Corsair Strafe RGB Pro with
Cherry MX Silent switches, and that served me well for a long time. However, I started
hearing more and more horror stories about people like me who end up with carpal tunnel
from typing all day, and decided that I didn‚Äôt particularly want that, so I began
looking around at various ergonomic options.

I saw some‚Ä¶ interesting keyboards, and some quite cool ones, but none of them stood out
to me as much as the [Ergodox EZ](https://ergodox-ez.com/). It was incredibly
well-designed and looked like it could fit into anyone‚Äôs workflow, but I wasn‚Äôt sure I
wanted to commit to the high price tag at the time.

It wasn‚Äôt until a few months later when I‚Äôd started spending a lot more of my days
typing that I decided to go all in on the ergo lifestyle and bought a few new things
like a new chair and a new pillow. I went back to look at the Ergodox EZ, having come to
terms with the fact that it would be worth the price, and lo and behold, ZSA, the
company behind the keyboard, had released something new! It was called the
[Moonlander](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander) (presumably because it would look right at
home on the S.S. Enterprise) and it was everything the Ergodox was and more. I watched a
few reviews, contemplated my switches and then took the plunge.

I ended up going for the white Moonlander with printed keys and Cherry MX Brown
switches. Basic, I know, but I wanted to go with something I knew I‚Äôd be comfortable
with ‚Äî the form factor of the board is enough of a departure from the norm for me for
now.

It took a little while to reach me in the UK, and even longer for me to get used to
typing on it and figure out the layout I wanted (every key is programmable!), but I‚Äôve
been using it as my daily driver for a few months now, and thought I‚Äôd share my thoughts
on it. TL; DR: I love the board and find it so much more comfortable to use than any
other keyboard I‚Äôve ever had. You can buy one here.

### Build and Feel

I cannot overstate how solid this keyboard feels. Even though it‚Äôs split in two, the
Moonlander feels really sturdy. The wrist rests on each half fold around to the back of
the board and use magnets to hold themselves there for travelling (the Moonlander comes
with a really nifty travelling case, but I‚Äôll get onto that a bit more later). They‚Äôre
also reasonably comfortable to use, though some people would argue that your wrists
shouldn‚Äôt be resting on anything while you‚Äôre typing.

I also like that just about everything on the Moonlander is adjustable to how you want
it. Not only is every key reprogrammable like I mentioned earlier, but the little metal
stand arms that come with it can be moved to either side of each half, adjusted how you
want to tilt the board for better ergonomics and tightened so they stay there
permanently.

Of course, I can‚Äôt write this section without mentioning the thumb modules on each side
of the board. These each have four keys. The big red keys are called the ‚Äòlaunch keys‚Äô,
and the other three large keys are the ‚Äòpiano keys‚Äô. While the launch keys are supposed
to be pressed with your index fingers, I love the fact that my thumb can now be used for
more when typing than just pressing space. This opens up a lot of room for customisation
that means you don‚Äôt have to move your hands as much. For example, by default the piano
keys are bound to space, enter, backspace and a few other things, so you don‚Äôt have to
move your hands around too much.

Of course, the thumb modules can also be tilted up or down as you choose depending on
how large your hands are.

It‚Äôs also worth mentioning that the keycaps and key switches are fully hot swappable, so
you can use whatever design and layout you like.

ZSA also provide enough information to make use of the mounting points that are on the
underside of each module, so you can build accessories for your Moonlander if you so
desire, or you can buy a [tripod kit](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander/tripod-kit) to
attach your keyboard to your chair!

### Software

The default layout that the Moonlander comes with certainly won‚Äôt be for everyone, and
is definitely more geared towards US layouts than UK ones. That‚Äôs understandable, of
course, but it took me some time to get things how I wanted them. Editing your layout is
all done through your browser, so no luck if you don‚Äôt have an internet connection, but
it does mean you can edit it from just about any computer.

However, if you actually want your layouts to be applied to your board, you have to
flash the firmware using software called Wally. In my opinion, since I‚Äôm having to
download Wally anyway, I‚Äôd rather just be able to do everything in one place, as
swapping back and forth can get quite annoying.

One benefit of having Wally to flash the firmware, however, is that you can plug your
Moonlander into anyone else‚Äôs computer and it‚Äôll keep all your customisations quite
happily.

Because the keyboard doesn‚Äôt have as many keys as most, you‚Äôll have to use the concept
of ‚Äòlayers‚Äô to get all the functionality you want. This is normally fine, and I‚Äôve
gotten used to it, but I do sometimes forget which symbols are where on my symbols
layer, since I can‚Äôt just glance at the keyboard for reference.

I do like that you can have different behaviours for pressing and holding keys, and the
macros came in useful when I wanted a key for the degree sign (¬∞), which can usually
only be accessed via an Alt code.

The Moonlander also comes with the option of having it play 8-bit sounds when you‚Äôre
typing, and even has a ‚ÄòMusic mode‚Äô that will disable input, allowing you to just jam
out at your desk. For me, this was cool for about 5 minutes until it became incredibly
annoying and got resigned to the realm of gimmick, but it might be more to your taste.

### Usage

The Moonlander is super comfortable to use. The keys feel solid and the typing
experience is nice. It has a nice sound to it too. While it did take me some time to get
used to, and some time to find my layout, now that I‚Äôve got it down I‚Äôm super happy with
how it performs and how pleasant it is to type on.

The only issues I really have with it are when I try to game using it. On the website,
ZSA insist that you can use just the left half of the keyboard (true), which makes it
gaming friendly. This is nice because it gives you more space for your mouse, but I‚Äôve
found that the layout of specific keys just doesn‚Äôt make for a nice gaming experience.

Of course, this is something I could solve by setting up a new layer specifically for
gaming, but I still feel that I‚Äôd get annoyed at times, especially if I has to switch
back and forth to use the chat functionality in the game (I play stuff online, and don‚Äôt
often make use of voice chat).

This has me switching back and forth to my Strafe sometimes, which I don‚Äôt find as
comfortable anymore. I suppose that really does say something about the Moonlander
though ‚Äî once you switch, you realise just how much better it is.

### Final Thoughts

I love this thing. I don‚Äôt think I could ever go back. As I mentioned earlier, it comes
with a travelling case which is really useful because I take my Moonlander to work with
me. I‚Äôd love to have a second one so I could leave it there (taking it back and forth
can be a bit of a hassle, especially if I forget it in either direction), but I‚Äôm not
sure I can totally justify the cost for a second board just for that.

The Moonlander is quite expensive compared to a lot of keyboards, but boy is it worth
it. I‚Äôm very grateful to the team at ZSA for designing this thing. They‚Äôre really onto a
winner, and I wish them the best of luck.
