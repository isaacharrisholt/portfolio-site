If you’ve ever tried to complete a data science project that revolves around personal
finances, you’re probably familiar with the joys of bank-exported CSV files for
transaction data.

Put short — they’re absolutely awful. Most banks will allow you to export your bank
statement as a CSV, but what a lot of them don’t tell you is how terribly structured
these CSV files are. Different banks use different header names for the amount,
reference and so on, and hard coding every single bank is nigh on impossible.

This is where QIF files come in. QIF, or Quicken Interchange Format, is a file format
developed by Intuit initially for use in their QuickBooks product. However, the format
is very old now (older than OFX, even).

Regardless of this, most banks and other financial institutions (stock brokers, etc.)
will offer QIF as an option when exporting your data. Despite its age, the QIF file
format is useful because:

- It’s standardised — no more hard coding different CSV schema for different banks
- It’s widely used
- It’s written in plain text, so it’s really easy to parse

[Quiffen](https://pypi.org/project/quiffen/) is a Python package for parsing QIF files
and exporting the data in more useful formats, such as dictionaries or pandas
DataFrames. Quiffen can be installed from the command line by running:

```bash
pip install quiffen
```

From there, you’re ready to start analysing your data!

## Parsing QIF Files

Below is a code sample of how to parse a QIF file and export the transactions within
into a DataFrame:

```python

from quiffen import Qif
qif = Qif.parse('test.qif')
print(qif.accounts)
# {'Quiffen Default Account': Account(name='Quiffen Default Account', desc='The default account created by Quiffen when no
# other accounts were present')}
acc = qif.accounts['Quiffen Default Account']
print(acc.transactions)
# {'Bank': TransactionList(Transaction(date=datetime.datetime(2021, 2, 14, 0 , 0), amount=150.0, ...), ...),
# 'Invst': TransactionList(...)}
tr = acc.transactions['Bank'][0]
print(tr)
# Transaction:
#     Date: 2020-02-14 00:00:00
#     Amount: 67.5
#     Payee: T-Mobile
#     Category: Cell Phone
#     Split Categories: ['Bills']
#     Splits: 2 total split(s)
df = qif.to_dataframe(data='transactions')
print(df.head())
#         date  amount           payee  ...                           memo cleared check_number
# 0 2020-02-14    67.5        T-Mobile  ...                            NaN     NaN          NaN
# 1 2020-02-14    32.0  US Post Office  ...  money back for damaged parcel     NaN          NaN
# 2 2020-12-02   -10.0          Target  ...        two transactions, equal     NaN          NaN
# 3 2020-11-02   -25.0         Walmart  ...          non split transaction       X        123.0
# 4 2020-10-02  -100.0      Amazon.com  ...                   test order 1       *          NaN
```

You can choose different data to export, such as the categories (which are represented
by trees) or the accounts stored in the `Qif` object. You can also export the data from
to a CSV with headers which will be consistent every time with the `to_csv()` method.

## Creating Your Own QIF Files

Quiffen also supports QIF structure creation and export! You can create your own `Qif`
objects and add accounts, transactions, categories, classes and more to it. An example
of this is shown below, but a full API reference can be found on the
[Quiffen docs](https://quiffen.readthedocs.io/en/latest).

```python
import quiffen
from datetime import datetime
qif = quiffen.Qif()
acc = quiffen.Account('Personal Bank Account', desc='My personal bank account with Barclays.')
qif.add_account(acc)
groceries = quiffen.Category('Groceries')
essentials = quiffen.Category('Essentials')
groceries.add_child(essentials)
print(groceries.render_tree())
# Groceries (root)
# └─ Essentials
qif.add_category(groceries)
tr = quiffen.Transaction(date=datetime.now(), amount=150.0)
acc.add_transaction(tr, header='Bank')
print(qif.to_qif())  # If a path is provided, this will save the file too!
# !Type:Cat\nNGroceries\nETrue\nIFalse\n^\nNGroceries:Essentials\nETrue\nIFalse\n^\n!Account\nNPersonal Bank Account\nDMy
# personal bank account with Barclays.\n^\n!Type:Bank\nD02/07/2021\nT150.0\n^\n
```

You can view the full source code for the Quiffen package on
[GitHub](https://github.com/isaacharrisholt/quiffen). Any feedback or
(constructive!) criticism is greatly appreciated!

I would highly recommend trying out Quiffen with your own transaction data, and if you
also want to check out the program that got my financial ass into gear, please do that
also!
