Python is… slow. This is not a revelation. Lots of dynamic languages are. In fact,
Python is so slow that many authors of performance-critical Python packages have turned
to another language — C. But C is not fun, and C has enough foot guns to cripple a
centipede.

Introducing Rust.

Rust is a memory-efficient language with no runtime or garbage collector. It’s
incredibly fast, super reliable, and has a really great community around it. Oh, and
it’s also _super easy_ to embed into your Python code thanks to excellent tools like
PyO3 and maturin.

Sound exciting? Great! Because I’m about to show you how to create a Python package in
Rust step-by-step. And if you don’t know any Rust, don’t worry — we’re not going to be
doing anything too crazy, so you should still be able to follow along. Are you ready?
Let’s oxidise this snake.

## Pre-requisites

Before we get started, you’re going to need to install Rust on your machine. You can do
that by heading to [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/) and following the instructions there.
I would also recommend creating a virtual environment that you can use for testing your
Rust package.

## Script overview

Here’s a script that, given a number n, will calculate the nth Fibonacci number 100
times and time how long it takes to do so.

This is a very naive, totally unoptimised function, and there are plenty of ways to make
this faster using Python alone, but I’m not going to be going into those today. Instead,
we’re going to take this code and use it to create a Python package in Rust

## Maturin setup

The first step is to install [maturin](https://www.maturin.rs/), which is a build system
for building and publishing Rust crates as Python packages. You can do that with
`pip install maturin`.

Next, create a directory for your package. I’ve called mine `fibbers`. The final setup
step is to run `maturin init` from your new directory. At this point, you’ll be prompted
to select which Rust bindings to use. Select `pyo3`.

Now, if you take a look at your `fibbers` directory, you’ll see a few files. Maturin has
created some config files for us, namely a `Cargo.toml` and `pyproject.toml`. The
`Cargo.toml` file is configuration for Rust’s build tool, `cargo`, and contains some
default metadata about the package, some build options and a dependency for `pyo3`. The
`pyproject.toml` file is fairly standard, but it’s set to use `maturin` as the build
backend.

Maturin will also create a GitHub Actions workflow for releasing your package. It’s a
small thing, but makes life _so_ much easier when you’re maintaining an open source
project. The file we mostly care about, however, is the `lib.rs` file in the `src`
directory.

Here’s an overview of the resulting file structure.

fibbers/  
├── .github/  
│ └── workflows/  
│ └── CI.yml  
├── .gitignore  
├── Cargo.toml  
├── pyproject.toml  
└── src/  
 └── lib.rs

## Writing the Rust

Maturin has already created the scaffold of a Python module for us using the PyO3
bindings we mentioned earlier.

The main parts of this code are this `sum_as_string` function, which is marked with the
`pyfunction` attribute, and the `fibbers` function, which represents our Python module.
All the `fibbers` function is really doing is registering our `sum_as_string` function
with our `fibbers` module.

If we installed this now, we’d be able to call `fibbers.sum_as_string()` from Python,
and it would all work as expected.

However, what I’m going to do first is replace the `sum_as_string` function with our
`fib` function.

This has exactly the same implementation as the Python we wrote earlier — it takes in a
positive unsigned integer n and returns the nth Fibonacci number. I’ve also registered
our new function with the `fibbers` module, so we’re good to go!

## Benchmarking our function

To install our `fibbers` package, all we have to do is run `maturin develop`in our
terminal. This will download and compile our Rust package and install it into our
virtual environment.

Now, back in our `fib.py` file, we can import `fibbers`, print out the result of
`fibbers.fib()` and then add a `timeit` case for our Rust implementation.

If we run this now for the 10th Fibonacci number, you can see that our Rust function is
about 5 times faster than Python, despite the fact we’re using an identical
implementation!

If we run for the 20th and 30th fib numbers, we can see that Rust gets up to being about
15 times faster than Python.

But what if I told you that we’re not even at maximum speed?

You see, by default, `maturin develop`will build the dev version of your Rust crate,
which will forego many optimisations to reduce compile time, meaning the program isn’t
running as fast as it could. If we head back into our `fibbers` directory and run
`maturin develop`again, but this time with the `--release` flag, we’ll get the optimised
production-ready version of our binary.

If we now benchmark our 30th fib number, we see that Rust now gives us a whopping _40
times_ speed improvement over Python!

## Rust limitations

However, we do have a problem with our Rust implementation. If we try to get the 50th
Fibonacci number using `fibbers.fib()`, you’ll see that we actually hit an overflow
error and get a different answer to Python.

This is because, unlike Python, Rust has fixed-size integers, and a 32-bit integer isn’t
large enough to hold our 50th Fibonacci number.

We can get around this by changing the type in our Rust function from `u32` to `u64`,
but that will use more memory and might not be supported on every machine. We could also
solve it by using a crate like
[num_bigint](https://docs.rs/num-bigint/latest/num_bigint/), but that’s outside the
scope of this article.

Another small limitation is that there’s some overhead to using the PyO3 bindings. You
can see that here where I’m just getting the 1st Fibonacci number, and Python is
actually faster than Rust thanks to this overhead.

## Things to remember

The numbers in this article were not recorded on a perfect machine. The benchmarks were
run on my personal machine, and may not reflect real-world problems. Please take care
with micro-benchmarks like this one in general, as they are often imperfect and emulate
many aspects of real world programs.

I hope you’ve found this article helpful, and that it’s encouraged you to try rewriting
performance-critical parts of your Python code in Rust. Be wary that while Rust can
speed up a lot of things, it won’t provide much advantage if most of your CPU cycles are
spent on syscalls or network IO, as those slowdowns are outside the scope of your
program.
