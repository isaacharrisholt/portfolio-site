### The Problem

When writing applications, one task you’ll face is preventing data leaks. How do you
make sure your users only see what they’re supposed to? It wouldn’t be great if I logged
into my email app and saw all my boss’ emails (or it might be if you’re good at your job
😉).

One common way of securing your data is having an _access control layer_ between your
API and your database. This could be anything from access policies enforced by your ORM
to a separate microservice that makes judicious use of `where`clauses when querying your
database.

For the most part, this works. But what happens if one of your engineers forgets a
`where` clause or access requirements change and you suddenly have to go and find a
million different places to change your access levels? Having a separate access control
layer can also add complexity to your code base — depending on how you implement it, you
may now have to maintain an additional module with its own set of concerns, design
patterns, idioms, and so on.

**Introducing Postgres’ row-level security, or RLS policies**.
[RLS policies are access policies that you define at the database level](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-rowsecurity.html),
removing the need for an external service and keeping latency to a minimum.

### How do RLS policies work?

> In addition to the SQL-standard privilege system available through GRANT, tables can

> returned by normal queries or inserted, updated, or deleted by data modification
> commands

— PostgreSQL documentation

When you query a table protected by RLS policies, Postgres will validate each row the
query returns against the policies on the table. Any rows that do not pass the check
will be stripped from the response.

For example, if we had the following table:

```sql
create table animal (  
  id bigint generated by default  
  as identity primary key, -- Autoincrementing pkey  
  species text not null,  
  name text not null  
);  
alter table animal enable row level security;

insert into animal (species, name) values  
  ('lion', 'Alex'),  
  ('zebra', 'Marty'),  
  ('giraffe', 'Melman'),  
  ('hippo', 'Gloria');
```

I could then apply an RLS policy to the table that only allows me to view data on lions.

```sql
create policy "allow anyone to read lions"  
on animal  
for select  
as permissive  
to authenticated  
using (species = 'lion');
```

Now, if I run `select * from animal` as a user in the `authenticated` group:

```
 id | species | name  
----+---------+--------  
 1  | lion    | Alex
```

Great! We’ve managed to restrict the data I have access to. But that `create policy`
statement is a little confusing. Let’s deconstruct it 🤓:

`create policy "allow anyone to read lions"`

This one’s easy! We’re creating a new policy called `allow anyone to read lions`. You
can call your policies whatever you like, but it’s worth being descriptive.

`on animal`

Again, quite straightforward — this policy is for the `animal` table. **Each policy can
apply to only one table.**

`for select`

This part of the query decides **when** the policy will run. In this case, we want
records to be checked against the policy when we use a `select` statement.

The other available options are `insert`, `update`, `delete` and `all`. The first three
cover their respective statements, and `all` will apply to all the CRUD operations
against the table.

If you use `merge` statements in your code, policies for any of the CRUD operations may
be applied depending on what the `merge` statement is doing.

`as permissive`

This is where things get interesting. There are **two ways** a policy can be applied to
a table — as a `permissive` policy or as a `restrictive` policy. **Policies are
permissive by default**.

Each does roughly as you’d expect — permissive policies define the set of records you’re
_permitted_ to read, whereas restrictive policies will _restrict_ you from reading a
particular record, even if there exists a permissive policy that grants you access to
said record.

You have to have at least one permissive policy to be able to query the table. A table
with only restrictive policies will not allow any queries at all.

Permissive policies are applied using a boolean “OR”, so you only need permission from
one permissive policy to be able to query a certain row. Restrictive policies, on the
other hand, are applied using a boolean “AND” — you have to pass _all_ restrictive
policies for every row you want to be able to read.

The overall logic looks something like this:

`(perm_pol_1 OR perm_pol_2 OR ... OR perm_pol_n) AND rest_pol_1 AND rest_pol_2 AND ... AND rest_pol_m`

I don’t often find myself reaching for a restrictive policy, preferring to use use a
slightly more complex permissive policy instead, as it keeps things closer together and
easier to reason about (and faster, though that’s a topic for the next article 😉).

Moving on:

`to authenticated`

The `to` portion of `create policy` defines the **roles** the policy applies to. In this
case, I’m using an example group called `authenticated`, but this could be any group you
like, or one of the Postgres defaults: `PUBLIC`, `CURRENT_ROLE`, `CURRENT_USER`,
`SESSION_USER`. These are based on the user _creating_ the RLS policy, not the user
querying! It’s best to target a specific role.

Beware, however, that any role with the `bypassrls` attribute will completely ignore any
RLS policies you have defined!

`using (species = 'lion');`

Finally, the good part! This is where the action happens. The `using` clause contains a
boolean expression that each of our rows is checked against.

There are **two available check clauses**: `using` and `with check`.

`using` is used to determine which rows are _visible_ to the user when the operation is
performed. It’s used in `select`, `update`and `delete` clauses. In the case of `update`
or `delete`, if you use
[Postgres triggers](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtrigger.html) as
part of your application, the using clause will be checked _after_ any `before` triggers
have run against the relevant rows.

`with check` is used to check that the results of `update` and `insert` statement are up
to snuff. These policies will run _after_ the action, but will prevent the action being
committed if they fail. In the case of `update`, you can use `with check` in combination
with `using` to create some really powerful policies.

You can think of the flow like this:

```
# update animal set name = 'Alexa' where species = 'lion'

START TRANSACTION

Before trigger runs

`using` clause check runs  
If `using` fails, ROLLBACK

UPDATE

`with check` clause check runs  
If `with check` clause check fails, ROLLBACK

COMMIT
```

You can use _any_ boolean expression in your `using` and `with check` clauses including
function invocations. The only requirement is that the expression returns a boolean
value.

For example, you could replace the above policy with the following:

```sql
create or replace function can_read_animal_using(a animal)  
returns boolean  
as $$  
  select a.species = 'lion'
$$
;

create policy "allow animal reads"
on animal
for select
as permissive
to authenticated
using (can_read_animal_using(animal));
```

Rather than using a simple inline policy, we are now passing the `animal` record that
the query is being run against to a function called `can_read_animal_using`. This
function checks that the animal’s species is a lion — returning `true` in the case that
it is, `false` otherwise.

There are many good reasons for adopting a pattern of using functions rather than inline
policies, and we’ll dive deeper into this in another article. For now though, let’s take
a look at how you might implement a useful set of RLS policies this in a production system.

### RLS in production with Supabase

I’m going to be using a Postgres database hosted on [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) as
an example. Supabase provides authentication and its client libraries will set some variables
in your database that make it really easy to see which user is making a particular query.
Supabase leans heavily on RLS policies for user access control, and they have
[their own guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/row-level-security) on the topic.

Supabase databases come pre-built with a schema called `auth`. The auth schema contains a
function called `uid()` which returns the current user’s unique ID as defined in the `auth.users`
table.

Let’s pretend we’re making a social recipe-sharing app. Users can create recipes which
are then visible to all of our other users. However, users should only be able to
insert recipes that they authored, and shouldn’t be able to update or delete other users’
recipes.

Note that our policies will only apply to _authenticated_ users. Anonymous users (not
signed in) should be able to read all recipes, but not do anything else.

As a first step, let’s define our table:

```sql
create table recipe (
  id bigint generated by default
    as identity primary key,
  author uuid not null references auth.users(id),
  title text not null,
  content text not null
);
-- RLS is not enabled by default. Make sure to set it
-- when creating new tables!
alter table recipe enable row level security;
```

Our first policy will allow all users to read all recipes:

```
create policy "allow anyone to read recipes"
on recipe
for select
to authenticated
as permissive
using (true);

create policy "allow anyone to read recipes"
on recipe
for select
to anon -- Allow anonymous users to read recipes
as permissive
using (true);
```

However, only the recipe owner should be able to create, update or delete recipes.
Whilst we’re at it, let’s also make sure that users can’t insert recipes with no
content! Even though we’ve defined the column as `not null`, a user could still
insert an empty string, which we don’t want.

```sql
create policy "allow authenticated users to insert recipes"
on recipe
for insert
to authenticated -- No anon this time
as permissive
-- The first check ensures that users can't insert recipes
-- while masquerading as other users
using (recipe.author = auth.uid() and length(recipe.content) > 0);

create policy "allow users to update their recipes"
on recipe
for update
to authenticated
as permissive
using (recipe.author = auth.uid())
-- Note the use of 'with check' rather than 'using' here
with check (recipe.author = auth.uid() and length(recipe.content) > 0);

create policy "allow users to delete their recipes"
on recipe
for delete
to authenticated
as permissive
using (recipe.author = auth.uid());
```

Now we have the rules we want: anyone can read recipes, but only the recipe author
can actually manage (update, delete) the recipe.

One of the really nice properties of RLS policies is that they enforce a _separation
of concerns_ between the security of your database and your business logic. A good
example of this is that I wanted to update _all_ of my recipe titles at the same time,
I could simply do the following:

`update recipe set title = 'Your favourite!'`

And _only_ my recipes would be updated!

Neat, right?

As all of this happens at the database level, there’s no need to worry about writing
`where` clauses everywhere or complicating your codebase with security concerns that
really belong with Postgres.

I hope this has been a useful introduction to Postgres RLS policies. We make extensive
use of Supabase and row-level security at Pluto, so we’ve picked up a lot of useful
tips, tricks and best practices for keeping your RLS policies readable, maintainable
and performant. Expect more articles soon!

Stay secure out there,
